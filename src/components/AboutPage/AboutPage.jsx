      <Typography className={classes.text}>Blue Collar Homeschool was born out of the desire to help families succeed, and to encourage those whose children are bound for post-high school experiences that include trade school, the military, apprenticeships, entrepreneurism, or are immediately entering the workforce.  Not every learner will attend college, and though our society seems to believe otherwise, there are a world of possibilities open to them!  We are here to offer you resources, ideas, encouragement, and concrete programs to help you on your homeschool journey.  So many web sites or online groups focus solely on college preparatory academics and sadly, many of us walking a different path often find we are ridiculed or judged when we ask questions about our kids who are meant for something other than a university.  Our web site and large Facebook group offer a safe place to discuss these challenges, while also providing a community that celebrates non-academic successes.</Typography>

      <Typography className={classes.text}>Blue Collar Homeschool was founded in 2017 by Cindy LaJoy.  A veteran homeschooler of a dozen years, she has now graduated all five of her internationally adopted children.  Among her young adults are a private pilot who is a web site designer, a college student pursuing a career in physical therapy, and three entrepreneurs who together run their own pizza and ice cream shop.  Cindy designed this business to accommodate their special needs as well as the learning challenges of others, as Buckaroos Slices and Scoops intentionally hires those with learning disabilities and developmental delays.</Typography>
